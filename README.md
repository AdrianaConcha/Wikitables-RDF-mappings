# Wikitables-RDF-mappings

## Overview
This repository provides mappings to extract RDF triples from clusters of Wikipedia tables using various mapping language processors. We provide example mappings to compare the different features and expressiveness of these tools, which are useful for extracting information from diverse table schemas. Additionally, the repository includes a benchmark consisting of 12 clusters of Wikipedia tables. This benchmark facilitates comparisons of the expressiveness and performance of processors that implement mapping languages for converting semi-structured data into RDF.
